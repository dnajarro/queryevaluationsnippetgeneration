# Query Evaluation and Snippet Generation
Third project of BYU's CS 453 Information Retrieval class. Uses Soundex codes and the Noisy Channel model for spelling correction. Ranks the corrected keyword queries based on probability distribution. Finally, generates snippets for the results based on each corrected query. See project description PDF for full explanation.
